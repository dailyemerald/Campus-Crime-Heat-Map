                      university-owned apartment
                      complex located about a mile
                      away from the UO main campus,
                      is no stranger to safety
                      concerns. <a href=

                      Complaints about crime sprees
                      from the complex’s residents go
                      back as far as 2006.</a>

                  <p>
                      It’s also been home to the most
                      crimes in the campus area over
                      the past year: 39.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The majority of the crimes
                      reported at Spencer View are
                      generally in line with the rest
                      of the campus area, just at a
                      much higher volume — namely
                      theft.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Kelly McIver, public
                      information officer for the
                      UOPD, thinks that the high
                      theft rate might stem more from
                      the high concentration of
                      people rather than a naturally
                      crime intensive area.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      “Any time you've got a living
                      situation where you've got many
                      units, every one of those units
                      potentially has a vehicle
                      connected to it, if it's parked
                      there,” McIver said. Spencer
                      View’s proximity to a
                      well-trafficked street is
                      likely a contributing factor as
                      well.

                      Derek Landon, a Lane Community
                      College student who lived next
                      to the complex for two years,
                      said he would often see police
                      cars at the apartments as he
                      came home. He added, however,
                      that “it didn’t seem like it
                      was anything too different from
                      any other complex.”

                      While high numbers can be
                      troubling at a glance, it’s not
                      always a negative. It could
                      mean that more people are
                      reporting crimes, according to
                      Leah Andrews, the director of
                      marketing and communications
                      for University Housing.

                                            Crime in the library is all
                                            “opportunity-based,” according to
                                            McIver.
                                        </p>

                                            The Knight Library had the second
                                            highest number of reported crimes
                                            last year. Theft was the most
                                            common, with 10 incidents reported.
                                            Theft is common in large buildings
                                            with constant traffic, according to
                                            the UOPD. The library adds another
                                            opportunity for thieves, as
                                            students studying often keep to
                                            themselves.

                                            Knight Library is open to students

                                            which makes it a likely target for
                                            people looking to steal expensive
                                            equipment like laptops or cell
                                            phones.

                                            find instances where people have
                                            left their things on a table while

                                            a book,” McIver said. “Then they
                                            can surreptitiously take stuff
                                            without anybody really noticing.”

                                            To combat crime, the university
                                            installed lockers for students to
                                            keep valuable possessions. After
                                            midnight, security officers are
                                            stationed at the front of the
                                            library, checking student IDs.

                                            Seven incidents of “criminal
                                            mischief” were reported at the
                                            library, the most of any location
                                            on campus. These usually involve
                                            people horsing around or otherwise
                                            not obeying the library’s noise
                                            ordinances. “There are people
                                            who'll go in there and they will
                                            use the facilities inappropriately
                                            or do other things that are
                                            inappropriate for people to do in a

                                              around campus behind Knight Library
                                              and Spencer View is the UO
                                              Riverfront. The Riverfront, just
                                              beyond Franklin Blvd may be the
                                              third heaviest area for crime
                                              around campus, but the majority of
                                              those crimes were of the same
                                              nature. Over the past year the
                                              Riverfront has seen more warrant
                                              arrests than any other area.
                                              Criminal trespassing is also a
                                              popular crime in the area.
                                              According to Kelly, those crimes
                                              are usually less about students and
                                              more about the homeless population
                                              in Eugene. “[Those charges] are
                                              usually going to derive from
                                              illegal camping on university
                                              property,” Kelly said.

                                              “So those are in locations where
                                              people are found to be camping
                                              illegally on the property or
                                              otherwise on university property in
                                              those areas… and conducting illegal
                                              activity, and upon contact we're
                                              finding that they have outstanding
                                              warrants.” Often times those
                                              warrant arrests are for failure to
                                              appear in court, but in some cases
                                              it’s for more serious charges such
                                              as violating parole, according to
                                              Kelly. So while the UO Riverfront
                                              may be relatively free of the most
                                              common campus crimes such as theft,
                                              the data shows it’s one of the more
                                              dangerous places for students to be
                                              wandering around alone.
