                      <p>UO RIVERFRONT:</p>
                      <p> The third most crime-intensive area around campus behind Knight Library and Spencer View is the UO Riverfront.
              The Riverfront, just beyond Franklin Blvd may be the third heaviest area for crime around campus, but the majority of those crimes were of the same nature.
              Over the past year the Riverfront has seen more warrant arrests than any other area. Criminal trespassing is also a popular crime in the area. According to Kelly, those crimes are usually less about students and more about the homeless population in Eugene.
              “[Those charges] are usually going to derive from illegal camping on university property,” Kelly said. </p>
              <p> “So those are in locations where people are found to be camping illegally on the property or otherwise on university property in those areas… and conducting illegal activity, and upon contact we're finding that they have outstanding warrants.”
              Often times those warrant arrests are for failure to appear in court, but in some cases it’s for more serious charges such as violating parole, according to Kelly.
              So while the UO Riverfront may be relatively free of the most common campus crimes such as theft, the data shows it’s one of the more dangerous places for students to be wandering around alone. </p>

                    <p>Knight Library:</p>
                      <p> The Knight Library had the second most reported crimes last year. </p>

<p> Theft was the most common, with ten incidents reported. Theft is common in large buildings with constant traffic, according to the UOPD. The library adds another opportunity for thieves, as students studying often keep to themselves. </p>

<p> “You're not up looking around, scanning the room,” McIver said. “If somebody had come and set a bag down and then walked off, and if you saw somebody else pick up that bag and leave, you probably wouldn't remember if that was the same person that brought that bag to begin with. So it's kind of an ideal environment for property crime.” </p>

<p> During certain parts of the term, Knight Library is open 24 hours a day, increasing the number of people who use the facility. McIver thinks this makes it a likely target for people looking to steal expensive equipment like laptops or cell phones. “There's definitely a criminal population that knows if they go in there they may well be able to find instances where people have left their things on a table while they've gotten up to go bring back a book,” McIver said. “Then they can surreptitiously take stuff without anybody really noticing.” </p>

<p> Seven incidents of Criminal Mischief were reported at the library, the most of any location on campus. These usually involve people horsing around, or otherwise not obeying the library’s noise ordinances. “There are people who'll go in there and they will use the facilities inappropriately or do other things that are inappropriate for people to do in a public space,” McIver said. </p> </div>

                     <p>Spencer View Apartments:</p>
                      <p> Spencer View is a university-owned apartment complex located about a mile off campus at 2250 Patterson Street. The complex is located next to two schools and a large city park.
It’s been home to the most potentially dangerous crimes in the campus area over the past year.
The majority of the crimes reported at Spencer View are generally in line with the rest of the campus area, just at a much higher volume than is seen anywhere else. The apartment complex has a very high number of theft, specifically vehicle and bike theft.
McIver thinks that the high theft rate might stem more from the high concentration of people rather than a naturally crime intensive area.
“Any time you've got a living situation where you've got many units, every one of those units potentially has a vehicle connected to it, if it's parked there.” McIver said. “You have bikes that many of the people have. Those bikes are both near the dwellings and also in bike racks.” </p>

<p> McIver also believes that the apartment complex’s location on a city street can increase the crime rate when compared to one of the dorms on campus.
“Basically you've got a combination of more people, and more opportunities for things to happen to that property,” McIver said.
While the high crime rate can be troubling at a glance, McIver points out that it’s not always a negative. </p>
<p> “Housing does a really good job of staying connected with their tenants and coaching them to report suspicious activity and report crimes,” he said.
“I think you probably have a higher than normal level of reporting that happens, which is good…there's probably a higher percentage of people from that location that are willing and interested in reporting crimes or reporting suspicious conditions.” McIver said.
Derek Landon, an LCC student who lived next to Spencer View for two years has a similar opinion.
“There were multiple times when I would be coming home and I would see police at the apartments,” He said. “But it didn’t seem like it was anything too different from any other complex.”
While the theft and other small crimes at Spencer View might be due to natural circumstances, the apartment complex has also seen a few more serious crimes over the past year including DUIIs, burglary and failure to register a sex offender. </p>

<p> The high theft rates aren’t going unnoticed either. Director of Marketing and Communications for University Housing Leah Andrews says that precautions are being taken. </p>

<p> “University Housing representatives from Spencer View recently met with UOPD to discuss additional safety measures like improved lighting and closed circuit cameras.” Andrews said.  </p> </div>
