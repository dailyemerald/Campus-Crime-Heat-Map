                                    Last week, the University of Oregon Police
                                    Department sent out two campus crime
                                    alerts: One for aggravated assault, one for
                                    armed robbery.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These crime alerts and advisory warnings
                                    students receive from the UOPD only show a
                                    glimpse of criminal activity on campus each
                                    week. The Emerald gathered data on all
                                    crimes reported to the UOPD between Nov.
                                    24, 2014 and Nov. 24, 2015: A year at UO in
                                    crime.

                                    These numbers refer to crimes committed on
                                    UO property and dealt with by the UOPD. For
                                    this map, Drug and Liquor Violations were
                                    omitted in order to focus the data more
                                    toward crimes concerning public safety.

                                    <li>Theft: 92 incidents were reported in
                                    almost every major building or parking lot
                                    on campus. This number excludes bike
                                    thefts, which are common enough to warrant
                                    their own category.

                                    in second and tended to congregate in areas
                                    slightly off campus, such as the Baker
                                    Center Downtown and the Riverfront Research
                                    Park.

                                    <li>Bike thefts: Often considered a rampant
                                    problem on campus and in the greater Eugene
                                    community, bike theft makes up its own
                                    category, with 64 reports.
                                    </li>

                                    The areas with the highest crimes are
                                    Spencer View Apartments, the Knight Library
                                    and the Riverfront:

                                            The third most crime-intensive area
                                            around campus behind Knight Library
                                            and Spencer View is the UO
                                            Riverfront. The Riverfront, just
                                            beyond Franklin Blvd may be the
                                            third heaviest area for crime
                                            around campus, but the majority of
                                            those crimes were of the same
                                            nature. Over the past year the
                                            Riverfront has seen more warrant
                                            arrests than any other area.
                                            Criminal trespassing is also a
                                            popular crime in the area.
                                            According to Kelly, those crimes
                                            are usually less about students and
                                            more about the homeless population
                                            in Eugene. “[Those charges] are
                                            usually going to derive from
                                            illegal camping on university
                                            property,” Kelly said.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            “So those are in locations where
                                            people are found to be camping
                                            illegally on the property or
                                            otherwise on university property in
                                            those areas… and conducting illegal
                                            activity, and upon contact we're
                                            finding that they have outstanding
                                            warrants.” Often times those
                                            warrant arrests are for failure to
                                            appear in court, but in some cases
                                            it’s for more serious charges such
                                            as violating parole, according to
                                            Kelly. So while the UO Riverfront
                                            may be relatively free of the most
                                            common campus crimes such as theft,
                                            the data shows it’s one of the more
                                            dangerous places for students to be
                                            wandering around alone.

                                            The Knight Library had the second
                                            highest number of reported crimes
                                            last year. Theft was the most
                                            common, with 10 incidents reported.
                                            Theft is common in large buildings
                                            with constant traffic, according to
                                            the UOPD. The library adds another

                                            students studying often keep to
                                            themselves.

                                            installed lockers for students to

                                            library, the most of any location
                                            on campus. These usually involve
                                            people horsing around or otherwise
                                            not obeying the library’s noise
                                            ordinances. “There are people
                                            who'll go in there and they will
                                            use the facilities inappropriately
                                            or do other things that are
                                            inappropriate for people to do in a
